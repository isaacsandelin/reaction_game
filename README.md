## **Features left to implement**
- Universal scores, this feature would store the top results of all the users who have played the game.
* Other reaction-type games, one idea is to create a game where the user should type a letter that shows up on the screen. 
+ The site is in different languages.
- Add sound for when the colors change so the visually impaired can play.
